        <h1>Hi! I'm Kayt!</h1>
        <p>You might know me as diet 7up, Kaytastrophe, Kayt_was_taken, or any of my other derivative usernames, but either way, you've found your way to my corner of the internet!</p>
        <p>While you're here, why not check out <a href="/projects">what I'm up to</a>!</p>

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <h3>Who are you?</h3>
        <p>I'm a student 🇺🇸! My pronouns are she/they 🏳️‍⚧️, and I have way too many hobbies.</p>
        <h3>What do you do?</h3>
        <p>I make stuff sometimes,,, and that's about it. I usually somewhat sarcastically describe myself as an artist who rarely draws, a programmer who rarely programs,
        and a student who rarely studies.</p>
        <h3>What languages do you know?</h3>
        <p>I mostly work in TS and python, but I'm currently learning Svelte!</p>
        <p>As for human languages, English is obviosuly my first language, but I'm trying to <a href="https://duome.eu/kayt_was_taken">self-teach</a> myself Dutch and Japanese! I'm also interested in learning
            or learning about ASL, Ukranian, German, Cantonese, Tagalog, and Indonesian.</p>
