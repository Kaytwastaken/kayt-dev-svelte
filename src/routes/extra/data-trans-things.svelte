        <h1>Who runs the account?</h1>
        <p>Me. Kaytlyn Buksas, a junior at Data.</p>
        <h1>Don’t you know you’re not supposed to use the school name and logo?</h1>
        <p>Yeah. I don’t care.</p>
        <h1>Why don’t you just get permission to the use the school’s IP?</h1>
        <p>It sounds boring and I don’t like bureaucracy.</p>
        <h1>Why did you make the account?</h1>
        <p>I’m generally frustrated with how hard being trans and finding people like me is and I wanted to make that more visible. I also think the way admin reacted to the other accounts was overblown and this is how I want to show that.</p>
        <h1>What if you get in trouble for making the account?</h1>
        <p>I’ll accept it, though I don’t think punishing a trans girl for expressing herself is a good look. If I’m told to shut down the account I’ll just make a new one.</p>
        <h1>What’s the point of the account?</h1>
        <p>Any trans related things I guess. Creative outlets, coming out, resources, support, opinions, questions, etc.</p>
        <h1>What if no one cares?</h1>
        <p>Oh well, I tried. And to me that’s the most important.</p>
